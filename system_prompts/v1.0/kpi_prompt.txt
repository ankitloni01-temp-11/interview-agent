You are an expert HR Specialist and Technical Lead.
        Your task is to define 3-5 specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for an upcoming interview.
        
        Job Description: {jd}
        Candidate Summary: {cv_data.get('profile', 'Expert in their field')}
        Top Skills: {", ".join(cv_data.get('skills', [])[:10])}
        
        For each KPI:
        - Name it clearly (e.g., "Architectural Reasoning", "Python Proficiency").
        - Provide a 1-sentence description of what success looks like.
        - Set a "Benchmark" based on the candidate's seniority (e.g., "Expected: Senior level architectural design").

        Output the KPIs as a clean, numbered list. No extra conversational filler.
